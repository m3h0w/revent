# First sphere: I

## Emotional Ownership

_Trusting and owning our experience when engaging with the community._

We are willing to trust and own our experience. We listen to ourselves and our needs and are willing to express them to others, also if we need help. We support and offer to hold each other through the experiences we each have. If we see someone looking lost, maybe we can ask them how are they doing. If someone asks us how are we doing, maybe we can tell them how we are actually doing :)

## Immediacy

_The direct experience of the world where all are equal participants in the dance of being and becoming._

Immediate experience is that which isn’t mediated by words or symbols: it is the direct experience of the world and of each other before we repackage it in language. In the immediate experience we are all equal participants in the dance of being and becoming, and we seek to meet ourselves and each other there. No idea can substitute for this experience.

# Second sphere: We

## Authentic Relating

_Uncovering more of ourselves through relating and sharing with others._

Core to our community is Authentic Relating. We seek to uncover more of ourselves through relating and sharing with others. We see the humanity in each other and accept where others are in their journeys. When we feel accepted, we can dare bring more of ourselves and feel met at a deeper level. This creates positive feedback loops for greater connection, and connection is at the center of how we are together.

## Consent

_Expanding comfort zones by trusting no one will push beyond our boundaries._

Our community values expanding our comfort zones and we often enjoy pushing each other’s boundaries. Our courage, openness, and sense of freedom rest on a foundation of trust in our boundaries being respected, and that no one will push beyond what we have consented to. In this way we can fearlessly push the limits and expand our comfortzones. So we ask each other for consent and avoid ambiguity.

# Third sphere: Us

## Community-building

_Being a part of a community, based on a foundation of social trust and safety._

We are an inclusive social space where everyone can find their place and feel welcome. Becoming part of our community is bigger than participating in a single event, and we make it easier for people who are already in the community to attend our events. In between events we have protocols in place to restore justice and community when there are conflicts. In this way we create a foundation of social trust and safety for all community members.

## Consensual Do-ocracy

_The power to decide lies with the doers, if you want to see something happen, simply step up and make it happen—just ask for good advice along the way!_

We believe that the power to decide should rest with the do-ers—those who are going to execute the decisions, and not with an external authority. In order to make a skillful decision, the do-er needs to gather perspectives, advice, and consent from those who will be affected by their decisions. The act of connecting with those who are dependent upon their decisions gives them the knowledge needed to act. One way do-ocracy works is that if you want to see something happen, you can simply step up and make it happen—just ask for good advice along the way!

## Leave better trace (also psychologically)

_Helping each other leaving better traces in physical & psychological realms._

Have you heard the expression “matter out of place,” also called “MOOP”? At the burn it is important that we help each other to keep the place nice and clean for everyone to enjoy. If you see something that you think is not supposed to be where it is, MOOP it - meaning take it to the place where it belongs, the MOOP-station (trash cans), or the forget-me-not box. At the same time we are also here to MOOP our brains, bodies and souls. What do we want to let go of? How can we leave the burn at the end and feel like we are a better, perhaps a more fresh and happy person?

## Co-creation & communal effort

_A burn is something we do together, bringing what we want to bring and doing what needs to be done as a collective._

We work without formal hierarchies and without any division between creator and consumer. Everything that happens happens because somebody chooses to do it for themselves and for others. We consider self-leadership sacred. What would your happiness be if you had not those for whom you shine?

## Unconditional gifting

_We come together in cooperation and play, not in commerce - the value of a gift is unconditional._

We come together in cooperation and play, not in commerce. We are devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value, neither does seek to advertise. We strive to expose each other to as few commercial messages and brands as reasonably possible.
