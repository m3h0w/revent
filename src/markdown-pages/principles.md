These are the 10 principles for [RE]vent. They have been created by the doocracy within inspiration from the principles of Burning Man, Circling, and Authentic Relating.

----

  

1. **Emotional ownership 

*Trusting and owning our experience.

  

We are willing to trust and own our experience. We listen to ourselves and our needs and aspire to express them to others, also if we need help. We support each other through the experiences we each have. In practice, if someone asks us how we are doing, we could tell them how we are actually doing. And the other way round too, if we see someone looking lost, maybe we can ask them how they are doing. 

  
  

2. **Immediacy

*A direct experience of the world in the dance of being and becoming.

 
Immediate experience is that which isn’t mediated by words or symbols: it is the direct experience of the world and of each other before we repackage it in language. In the immediate experience,we are all equal participants in the dance of being and becoming, and we seek to meet ourselves and each other there. One way immediacy is expressed in practice is by withdrawing from the need to take a photograph by recognizing that this intention is connected with the future. Instead, we can choose to stay fully present in the experience itself. Let's meet each other in the now!

  
  

3. **Authentic Relating 

*Uncovering ourselves 

Authentic relating is core to our community. We seek to uncover more of ourselves through relating and sharing with others. We see the humanity in each other and accept where others are in their journeys. When we feel accepted, we can dare to bring more of ourselves and feel met at a deeper level. This creates positive feedback loops for greater connection - and connection is at the center of how we are together.

  
  

4. **Consent 

*Expanding comfort zones by trusting no one will push beyond our boundaries without our consent.

 Our courage, openness, and sense of freedom rest on a foundation of trust in our boundaries being respected, and that no one will push beyond what we have consented to. In this way, we can fearlessly push the limits and expand our comfort zones. So we ask each other for consent when we interact with each other and avoid ambiguity, especially when touch is involved.

  

5. **Community-building

*Being a part of a community, based on a foundation of social trust and safety. 

  

We are an inclusive social space where everyone can find their place and feel welcome. Becoming part of our community is bigger than participating in a single event, and we make it easier for people who are already in the community to attend our events. In between events we have protocols in place to restore justice and community when there are conflicts. In this way we create a foundation of social trust and safety for all community members.

  
  

6. **Consensual Do-ocracy

*The power to decide lies with the doers. All of us can step up and make things happen. 

  

We believe that the power to decide should rest with the do-ers—those who are going to execute the decisions, and not with an external authority. In order to make a skillful decision, the do-er needs to gather perspectives, advice, and consent from those who will be affected by their decisions. The act of connecting with those who are dependent upon their decisions gives them the knowledge needed to act. One way do-ocracy works is that if you want to see something happen, you can simply step up and make it happen—just ask for good advice along the way!

  
  

7. **Leave better trace (also psychologically)

*Helping each other leaving better traces in physical & psychological realms

  

Have you heard the expression “matter out of place,” also called “MOOP”? At the burn we help each other to keep the place nice and clean for everyone to enjoy. If we see something that we think is not supposed to be where it is, we will MOOP it - meaning take it either to the place where it belongs, or the MOOP-station (trash cans), or the lost-and-found box. At the same time we are also here to MOOP our brains, bodies and souls. What do we want to let go of? How can we leave the burn at the end and feel like we are a better, perhaps a more fresh and happy person? 

  

8. **Co-creation & communal effort

*A burn is something we do together, bringing what we want to bring and doing what needs to be done - as a collective.

  

We work without formal hierarchies and without any division between the creator and the consumer. Everything that happens, happens because somebody chooses to do it for themselves and for others. We consider self-leadership sacred. What would your happiness be if you had not those for whom you shine? 

  
  

9. **Unconditional gifting

*We come together in cooperation and play, not in commerce - the value of a gift is unconditional.

  

We are devoted to sharing gifts and we strive for it to happen unconditionally. Unconditional gifting does not contemplate a return or getting something in exchange but comes from a place of abundance and honest willingness to share. Also, we invite all those who receive to remember that when someone shares a gift, he or she also feels given to by the very act of the other person accepting the gift. So let's not be shy about taking - the givers need receivers!

  
  

10. **Meta-principle of evolutionary nature

*As community evolves, principles evolve.

  

A very important 10th principle is the meta-principle of evolutionary nature: these principles will keep evolving! Our wish for the principles is that they will be used to guide us when we immerse ourselves in the burn with each other. We see principles as a reflection of our community, and therefore they must evolve to stay anchored in who we are. If you want to be a part of the further development of the principles, explore them through workshops, or express them in more poetic ways do reach out. We create them, and they create us?

**As comunity evolves principles evolve

On Tuesday the 20th from 17-19 Piotr & Viola will honor the 10th principle and do a "Tea'n talk on principles" in the Gate of Reconnection Tent.  
Bring yourself, a cup of tea and join the exploration of the principles. We define them, do they define us?
